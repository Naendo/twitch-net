# Introduction

## Before you get started!

Before you start using this library, you should verify, that you are have a decent understanding of the language you are about to use. Some concepts you should have touched with are: [Asynchronous Programming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/) (TAP), [Interfaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/interfaces) and [Dependency Injection]("https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-5.0").
