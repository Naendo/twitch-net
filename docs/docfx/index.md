# Twitch .NET Documentation



## What is Twitch .NET?

Twitch .NET is an modular, asynchronous, multi-platform .NET Library used to interface the [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) API.

## Where to begin?

If you are into creating chatbot like system, you may have already used [Discord .NET]("https://docs.stillu.cc/"). If that's the case, you will find some very similar approaches to the surface API. Although if you are a beginner, you should refer to the [Intro]("#") for tutorials.

More experienced users should definitely consider using our [API Documentation]("") for a more in-depth look.
